## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI project designed to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for a call center. The dashboard provides insights into agent performance, call volume trends, and customer satisfaction using a variety of metrics. The dataset used is named "Call Center Dataset."

## KPIs Analyzed

The dashboard tracks and visualizes several key performance indicators that are crucial for managing and improving call center operations:

1. Average Talk Duration by Agent: The average time agents spend on calls with customers.
2. Average Speed of Answer by Agent (Seconds): How quickly each agent answers incoming calls.
3. Average Speed of Answer by Month (Seconds): The average time it takes for calls to be answered, aggregated by month.
4. Average Satisfaction Rate by Month: Customer satisfaction rates averaged over each month.
5. Monthly Call Volume Trend: The trend of incoming and outgoing calls over time, showing peaks and drops in activity.
6. Resolved vs Unresolved Calls by Topic: Visualizes the number of resolved and unresolved calls based on different topics or issues.


## Slicers and Filters
The dashboard includes several interactive slicers for detailed analysis:

- Date: Filter data by specific time periods.
- Agent: Focus on the performance of individual agents.
- Resolved (Y/N): Filter calls based on whether the issue was resolved or not.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is included in the repository:

Call Center Dataset: This dataset contains information on calls, agents, and customer feedback.

## Features
- Performance Monitoring: Evaluate individual agent performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Trend Analysis: Monitor monthly call volumes and speed of answers to understand workload fluctuations and efficiency.
- Customer Satisfaction: Track how satisfaction rates evolve over time and explore the link between call handling and customer happiness.
- Call Resolution Insights: Gain insights into the most common topics causing unresolved calls and focus on resolving these issues.

## Conclusion
The Call Center Performance Dashboard provides a powerful and interactive tool for managing and improving call center operations. By tracking key performance indicators such as agent talk time, speed of answer, satisfaction rates, and call resolution, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making. It helps identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and improve customer service. The ability to filter by various criteria such as date, agent, and resolution status makes the dashboard adaptable to different use cases, providing managers with actionable insights to enhance both individual and overall call center performance.
